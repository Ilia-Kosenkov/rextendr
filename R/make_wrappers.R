# this file will eventually contain code to read wrapper info from a Rust
# library and write to a desired location.

# some relevant notes:
# to get the name of the current package, use code such as the following:
# library(desc)
# library(here)
#
# x <- desc(file = here("DESCRIPTION"))
# x$get("Package")
